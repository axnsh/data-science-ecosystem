🌟 Data Science Ecosystem

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my very first GitHub project, created as part of my final submission for the IBM Tools for Data Science course. 🎓

This notebook is a beginner-friendly introduction to the Data Science Ecosystem — a place where tools, languages, and libraries come together to make data magic happen. 
✨ Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on the basics, this project is a fun and simple way to get familiar with the landscape of data science.


📘 What You'll Find

Inside this repo, you'll find:

🧠 A Jupyter Notebook that outlines the key players in the data science world

🛠️ An overview of essential tools like SAS, Apache Hadoop, and TensorFlow

💬 A look at the most-used programming languages in the field

📊 Basic math and code examples using Python

✍️ Markdown cells to explain concepts clearly

✅ A checklist of what was covered in the notebook (you’ll see a cool table too!)



🚀 Why This Project?

This project was created to:

Wrap up the IBM Tools for Data Science course

Practice using Jupyter Notebooks

Understand the structure of the data science workflow

Share a cool and simple project with the world 💪



🧰 Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook (hosted on Watson Studio or locally
